<h3> <ul> <li>Script1</li></h3>
  <p>This program asks the user to input the directory path where the files are located. It then gets a list of the files in the directory and sorts them by name. The program then loops through the files, extracts the file extension and renames each file in ascending numerical order, starting from 001 and adding leading zeros to ensure the filenames are the same length. Finally, it uses the os.rename method to rename each file with its new name. </p></ul>
<ul> <li><h3>Script2</h3></li></ul> 
<p> This script is a simple random number generator</p>
